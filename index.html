    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p class="padding">I am 27 and currently live in Manchester. Alongside studying coding, I volunteer in a digital marketing capacity for a podcast about the UK Prison System <a href ="//https.birdpodcast.co.uk">Bird</a>.
       In my spare time I enjoy hiking and I'm currently planning on a multi-day hike across Northern Spain.</p>

        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p class="padding">After studying English at Lancaster University, I began copywriting for different companies, 
        covering topics such as travel, music and restaurant reviews.</p>
        <p class="padding">I then worked for a property developer as part of their in-house digital team for a number of years. 
            Initially employed as a content writer, my role developed, and <b>I became a Digital Marketing Executive</b>.
            Here, I was responsible for maintaining multiple websites, online advertising and email marketing.</p>

    <h3>My Interest in Coding</h3>
    <p class="padding">As I had some understanding of the creation of websites, I decided to upskill and learn how to code, with the <b>goal
    of becoming a Junior Web Developer.</b>
    <br>
    I intend on utilising my digital marketing expertise, alongside the coding skills 
    I have learnt to become more employable.</p>

<div class="center">
    <h3>Why I joined Code Nation</h3>
    <p class="padding">After some research about Coding Bootcamps in Manchester, I came across Code Nation.
    Their 3 week course seemed an ideal opportunity to dip my toe in the water and test my aptitude for coding.</p>
