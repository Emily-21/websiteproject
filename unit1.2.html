<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.</h1>

</div>

<div class="padding">
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own 
website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
 <h4>E.g. Visual Studio Code, CodePen, Trello</h4>

 <p>I am starting to find that <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> 
    is really helpful with starting a website. Initially I found it a bit overwhelming as there were multiple 
    features that <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> doesn't have,
     but I now see the value in these. Firstly, as VSC auto-fills in the HTML segment of the file, 
     it saves a lot of time and also prevents me from making any coding errors straight away. 
     As you are writing code, the software also highlights any errors, which is great if you are new to coding.
      It’s also relatively simple to link different HTML pages together using the file path which is something 
      I don’t think you could do on CodePen.</p>

      <p> I am finding <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> extremely helpful in staying on track of what needs to be done. The software is intuitive,
     and as it’s a web application I can access it from anywhere with a wifi connection. Furthermore, as there’s 
     also a phone app I can also see my to-do list on my commute. I can add comments quickly and amend details on
      a card super easily.  
</p>

<div class="padding">
 <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h2>
<h4>E.g. Visual Studio Code, CodePen, Trello</h4>
<p>I believe the IT tools selected have been appropriate, as I’ve now learnt you don’t need to
     have lots of expensive software to build a simple, functioning website. I think I’ve really made the most 
     of Trello, as I had used it previously but didn’t use it to its full potential, by creating lots of boards 
     you can see how smaller projects work in tandem. 
</p>
    <p>In building the website and in answering these questions I have spent a lot of time 
        using Google Docs to plan and write my answers. It’s much easier to type on a blank document than on 
        the coding terminal in VSC, so I would say if there was some sort of software where you could link the
         documents to certain pages and sort of see a bigger picture/plan of your website that would be a valuable
          tool to use alongside the others. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="padding">
<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h2>
<h4>Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
 interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
 <p>I think my website is fairly simple, but it fulfills the brief. I’ve been quite surprised how straightforward it has been to build, and I feel enthusiastic about improving my skills further. I think the website could have some nicer features, probably using Javascript for slicker transitions and maybe some more interactive elements. 
 </p>
   <p>
    As well as adding Javascript, I would add some more images to the website to make it a bit more engaging. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="padding">
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
<p>
    I would improve my website by making it responsive for mobile and tablet screens. I would change the menu style to be a burger menu on mobile so it can fit on the screen. 
    Secondly I would want to make the website more interactive, using Javascript to create smoother transitions between pages, and having a nicer scrolling style throughout.  
</p>
    <p>Finally, I could also include a contact form, which would send any enquiries directly to my email address. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="padding">
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
<p>The aim for the project was that I would design and build a website talking about myself and my 
    interest in technology. I believe that I have certainly demonstrated this, talking about my digital 
    background and what I want to gain from this course.</p>
    
<p>I have learnt and applied HTML to structure my website effectively, including linking to internal pages
     through a navigation bar and linking to external websites. I have applied CSS to add styling to the website
     as well as re-sizing an image and saved it as a JPEG to ensure it is a good enough quality for my homepage,
     without slowing down the loading speed.</p>
    
<p>I have then answered each question to the best of my ability, researching topics online plus using 
    knowledge I already have to answer the questions fully.</p>
