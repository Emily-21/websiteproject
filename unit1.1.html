<h2>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>  
<p>IT is fundamental for the running of nearly all modern businesses. Using technology saves time, saves money,
increases productivity and flexibility, is safer, has hugely improved communication and has allowed businesses 
to operate within a global market. 
</p>
<p>Firstly from an internal, operational point of view: Most staff work on computers day-to-day using programmes
 like the Microsoft Office Suite e.g. Excel and Word, for inputting data and writing documents - using this software 
saves time and prevents manual errors. Files can be saved and stored within a cloud system instead of a filing 
 cabinet, making data safe from fire/theft/damage. Further to this, sharing and duplicating files 
 can be facilitated easily; allowing access to multiple people means teams can work collaboratively as well as 
 remotely. As businesses use shared drives, access can be granted to allow staff to work remotely, from home or 
 on the train, increasing flexibility and productivity, and even, <a href ="https://www.grantmcgregor.co.uk/2017/how-technology-can-help-you-grow-your-business/" 
 target="_blank">staff happiness</a>.</p>

 <p>Secondly, communication, both internally and externally is improved massively through IT. Most businesses 
use email to distribute any type of information; it’s the cheapest and quickest method to communicate between
staff, B2B and B2C. Using email means you can contact people out of office hours (unlike on the phone) 
and is far quicker than sending letters in the post.</p>

<p>Finally, IT massively increases the opportunities for reaching customers. Websites can reach 
customers worldwide without the need of any high-street presence; if you have enough content knowledge,
expertise and seo-friendly copywriting, there’s ample opportunity to rank highly within 
search engines. Businesses can reach new customers cheaply through online advertising and 
email marketing (often much less expensive than traditional advertising methods), whilst customers can make 
sales out of normal working hours, without leaving their homes. Businesses can run 24/7. Technology can also 
be used to improve a business’s service by using things like chatbots to answer FAQ's. You can gather 
customer feedback using surveys or <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank">Hotjar</a> on websites, 
meaning you can easily identify pain points, and <a href=https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/business-strategy-planning/innovate/pages/4-ways-innovation-can-help-your-business.aspx"
target="_blank">improve your offering.</a></p>

<h2>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
  <h4>What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>

  <p>Any digital project needs a focused brief, with a detailed scope of work, budget breakdown and
      clear deadlines. Having an agreed brief is fundamental in ensuring a good working relationship
      between the client and the agency, and also ensures everyone is working to the same deliverables.
      </p>

<p>Having a focused Project Manager who can delegate tasks amongst the team is crucial. 
    There are many task management softwares available to delegate tasks with individual
     deadlines, such as <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> or 
     <a href="https://resourceguruapp.com/" target="_blank">ResourceGuru</a>. By using task management software, 
     the PM should have a clear overview of what each team member is working on, how the bigger 
     project is progressing, plus, the team can see what their colleagues are working on as well.
     The PM should also ensure everyone is tracking their working hours on each task as this is 
     essential for accurate billing.</p>

     <p>Strong communication and teamwork are both fundamental skills required for a successful project.
     Using software such as <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" target="_blank">Slack</a> or
     <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">Jira</a> means you can quickly ask
     colleagues questions (especially if staff work remotely) and share files and code easily. Having 
     excellent communication ensures things aren’t missed by people working in isolation, and also ensures 
     tasks aren’t duplicated.</p>

     <p>As the project progresses, it’s easy for the scope to increase, usually as the client’s requirements change.
    It’s important to effectively manage these expectations and keep documents updated to reflect budget and 
    timescale increases. Working in an agile way, where you get sign off at regular stages within a project 
    can help manage expectations.
    <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/10-rules-of-highly-successful-project-management.php" target="_blank">
    Completing deliverables in smaller chunks</a> can avoid unnecessary duplication of work, and keeps the
    team and the client happy.</p>

    <p>Finally, once a project has been completed, it 
    <a href="https://www.nutcache.com/blog/10-tips-managing-successful-projects/" target="_blank">should be evaluated</a>. 
Whilst it’s easy to overlook this and jump straight into a new project, there are always lessons to be 
learnt, and if the team can identify areas of difficulty together, they can make an action plan to avoid the
same situation in the future.</p>

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. </h2>
    <h4>How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h4>
    <p>Please have a look at my <a href="https://trello.com/b/wSK8VVpJ/plan-and-carry-out-tasks-using-it"
    target="_blank">Trello board</a>, which I used to plan my website.</p>

<div class="padding">
  <h2>1.4  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
      <h4>What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h4>

<p>Digital projects can fail because of communication issues. Whether that’s between the client and the agency,
or between different departments within a business, or even between teammates, a lack of 
understanding can be very risky for digital projects. As explained in a study by Code Computer Love, 
<a href="https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/why-digital-projects-fail">'silos 
    between Marketing and IT'</a> was one of the most common reasons digital projects failed.
 Teams working in isolation can lead to misunderstandings between what is expected, and what is actually achievable 
 within the parameters of budget and time.</p>
 <p>Another risk to a digital project is having a poorly defined scope. This leaves requirements 
open to interpretation and therefore, expectations are not met, work has to be repeated and projects go over-budget. 
This also ties in with 
<a href="https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/"
target="_blank">scope creep</a>, where once a digital project is underway, client/stakeholders requirements change.
 This causes deliverables to increase, sometimes without being factored into existing budgets and timescales. 
 Any new deliverables should be reflected in an updated scope of works. Furthermore, managing your budget effectively
is fundamental to the success of your digital project, e.g. invoicing correctly and keeping track of hours spent 
prevents you going over budget.
</p>
<p>A further reason digital projects can fail is
 <a href="https://www.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process" target="_blank"
 >expecting perfection</a>. Rather than trying to create a brand new piece of software that does everything perfectly, implementing 
    small changes bit by bit, is more time efficient. Waiting until something is perfect often means deadlines
     are pushed back. Whereas if you work in sprints, making frequent changes to a website, you will be able 
     to get new code live quicker, ready for user testing, and can stay on track with timescales. 
</p>

<div class="padding">
    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
    <h4>How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h4>

<p> Initially I would start by writing down my requirements for the job, i.e. what do I need my software
        to do? Once I had compiled a list of requirements, I’d begin researching different systems and software
        online. There are lots of articles compare different software, giving honest 
        and impartial reviews. Once I had a rough idea of what’s available, I’d speak to colleagues and peers 
        about what software they use and hear their recommendations. 
    </p>
<p>I’d then assess what my budget could afford; most big softwares 
        have a ‘free’ version which may cover everything I’d need to begin with. 
        If I did decide to use a paid service, it would be worth checking what type of contracts were 
        available; if the project is short, I may only need to pay for a couple of months instead of 
        the yearly cost, it just depends on the requirements of the project. 
</p>
<p> Next I’d determine my support needs. Most big software firms have 24/7 phone support or live chat, 
        which may be important if my website server went down. You can often pay more 
        for different levels of support, so this would also be factored into my tech decision. 
    </p>
<p>Finally, there are usually free demo’s of different software, accessed either on their 
        website or by signing up for a free trial. I’d try and sign up for a free trial for a 
        week or a month to test it fully before I committed to purchasing a license. This way 
        I could find out which software fitted best with my requirements.
    </p>

<div class="padding">
    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
    <h4>How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h4>

<p>Having used two different types of coding programmes, <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>
     and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> I can see the pros and 
    cons for both. Visual Studio Code is used industry wide, and provides lots of help and hints as you code,
     whereas CodePen is saved online so you can access it everywhere, and as it updates in real time, you can 
     see your code errors immediately. At present I prefer CodePen as it’s a simpler software which suits my 
     relatively simple needs, but I can understand that Visual Studio Code would be better when I would be 
     using more advanced code.
</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" target="_blank">Slack</a>
     have been really helpful in working on digital projects. Firstly Slack is great for 
    accessing files from anywhere and it’s really easy to collaborate and talk with colleagues, sharing bits 
    of code and useful guides with each other. Trello is great for working on large scale projects, you can create
     different boards for different elements of the digital project and within that set up various to-do lists
      with deadlines, where you can assign different team members different tasks. There's also a notification
       setting to remind you when your tasks are due and also if people add comments to your work.

    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
    <h4>How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>

<p>The legal guidelines that impact digital projects are centered around the safe storage and fair usage of personal data. Every UK company has to comply with the EU regulation, GDPR which came into force in May 2018. GDPR was created to strengthen data protection laws for all EU citizens. This particularly impacts companies where customers may input data on websites, and companies whose customer databases hold personal/sensitive data which could identify a person, e.g full name, address, credit card details, IP address. 
    </p>
<p> <a href="https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-gdpr-general-data-protection-regulation-understanding-and-complying-gdpr-data-protection" 
        target="_blank">DigitalGuardian.com</a> have summarised the key requirements of GDPR as the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing</li>
   <li>Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy</li>
   <li>Providing data breach notifications</li>
   <li>Safely handling the transfer of data across borders</li>
   <li>Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Under GDPR regulations, individuals have to agree to having their data stored and used. Usually this consent 
    is gained through the acceptance of privacy policies on company websites. Data processing has to have a 
    <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/711097/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-1-0.pdf"
     target="_blank">‘lawful basis’</a>, i.e consent has been given and is relevant to what the customer expects the data to be used 
    for. An individual can request to see what data is held on them, and also request removal from a company 
    database at any time.
</p>
<p> Processing website data is highly important to implementing new digital strategy. Using cookies to advertise, 
    A/B testing or monitoring web traffic can increase business, but this data needs to be anonymised. By not 
    collecting IP addresses, you can still look at customer trends in a GDPR compliant way.
</p>
<p>Each company has to appoint a Data Controller who is responsible for ensuring data is stored safely and 
        is GDPR compliant. The Data Controller has to notify authorities of a data
        breach within 72 hours, and notify the people who are subject to the breach as soon as possible. 
       Customer data needs to be safely stored (digitally and physically) to 
        prevent such a data breach from taking place, because if a company is found to be non-compliant, they 
         can be <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/gdpr-fines-explained" target="_blank">fined up to 4% of their global annual turnover</a>.
