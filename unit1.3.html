<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
<h4>Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h4>
<p>There have been some great benefits of using a system such as <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/" target="_blank">Slack</a>; we’ve been able to send and receive files 
    from the course leaders to students, and also message fellow students with helpful websites and resources we’ve
     found. So that has proved a really efficient method of distributing information and content. 
</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> has been beneficial in making my website, in terms of ensuring the content has been a priority, 
    as with the to-do lists you can keep an eye on multiple tasks in tandem. However one drawback of only using 
    Trello for designing the website is that I didn’t have a visual idea of what I wanted my website to look like,
     and how all the pages were going to link together. I think I would have also benefited from an IT tool/system
      where I could have sketched the rough design/layout of the site instead of just writing it down. 
</p>
   <p>As we all had different ideas of what we wanted our websites to look like and the content for each person's 
       site would be different, I’m not convinced it would have saved much time working collaboratively. If we were 
       still using <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>, then working together to set up the HTML5 pages would have been useful, but as it was 
       already pre-populated in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> there wasn’t much we could have worked on together in terms of 
       final outcome. However, I think we have worked together to apply the HTML and the CSS and help each other out 
       with parts we have forgotten. 
</p>

<div class="padding">
<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
<p>I think it would have been more efficient if we knew the entire requirements of the website from the beginning.
     As mentioned in previous answers, having a fully defined brief means you can work to specific time scales and
      therefore don’t get behind, however as more outcomes have been added and timescales reduced, it has been 
      difficult to manage my time efficiently. This also links in to 
      <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/workest/top-10-ways-to-improve-employee-efficiency/" target="_blank">good communication</a>;
       ensuring everyone within a team knows what’s required of them creates a much higher rate of efficiency. 
    
</p>
<p>In terms of productivity it’s really useful to have deadlines enforced on tasks, otherwise they can span multiple
     weeks unnecessarily. Sometimes I also find it useful to set myself a deadline as I have done on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/wSK8VVpJ/plan-and-carry-out-tasks-using-it" target="_blank">Trello cards</a>, just so I can keep the project moving forward by ticking items off my list.
</p>
<p>In this project I have learnt to <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/15-ways-to-increase-productivity-at-work.html" target="_blank">let go of perfection</a> - I can’t design the website
     exactly as I would have liked as it will take too long. It’s unnecessary to make it look amazing if I have 
     no content to populate the website. By just simply getting the basics done, I have achieved more in less time,
      rather than perfecting each element, this is also a useful lesson to learn in web development in general.

3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.
</h2>
<h4>What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4>
<p>Next time I would require a fully comprehensive brief from which I could split up the tasks using 
    Trello to give each content item a deadline. I could use a time management software to make sure 
    I’m not spending too long on certain tasks, as I have definitely done that within this project, 
    spending far too long on unit 1.1.
</p>
   <p>I would also investigate if there was a software that I could mock up the wireframes of the website 
       that I could link to from Trello, as I am quite a visual person I think that would have really helped 
       me to see the requirements of the entire website. 
</p> 
   <p>I could also improve my productivity by downloading the apps for Trello and Slack onto my mobile phone.
        This would mean I could make the most of my commuting time by preparing myself for the day ahead and 
        replying to any messages rather than this taking some time each morning once I logged in. It would 
        also mean I could keep in touch with my colleagues and ask any questions when I’ve been working on 
        the project from home.
