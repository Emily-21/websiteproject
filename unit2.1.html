    <h1>Unit 2, Outcome 1: Create structures and styles for a webpage</h1>
        
        </div>

<div class="padding">
    <h2>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page.</h2>
    <p>Initially I started with a simple ‘Home’ HTML root page, including details of my work history
         and how I developed an interest in coding. Using VSC was very helpful as it populated all of the 
         ‘head’ content ready for me to start adding my content in HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then created new, separate HTML files on VSC in the same root folder; one file for each page I wanted
         on my website. I decided to create one page for each segment of the task; so I have a page per outcome
          (4 outcomes) plus a ‘Home’ and a ‘Contact Me’ page with different ways to get in touch with me. 
        </p>
    <p>On each page I added a Heading 1 for the page title, then added Heading 2's for the coursework questions. 
        I then populated my answers using the paragraph tags. I created a simple CSS style for headings and paragraphs to 
        ensure consistency throughout all the coursework pages.</p>

<h2>1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>

<p>Copyright in the UK is automatically applied to any original work, and stops other people from copying
     or stealing your work. Alongside music, film and literature, 
    this also applies specifically to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/copyright" target="_blank">“original non-literary written work, such as software, 
    web content and databases”</a> so is highly relevant in this industry.
</p>
<p>Your work is protected from other people replicating it, in most cases for a minimum of 50 years.
     As well as your original works not being copied, you also have to respect other copyrights, 
     for example using photographs without paying for them would be a breach of copyright unless 
     sourced legitimately via a service like <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/" target="_blank">Getty Images</a> or <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.
</p>
<p>Another constraint affecting websites would be the many different screen sizes we use to access the web,
it can be difficult designing a website only on desktop, when it behaves totally differently on a mobile screen.
We have to design flexibly and ensure our sites work across many devices to ensure great user experience.

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - 
describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>

<p>Some internet users access websites through 
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/" target="_blank">‘assistive technology’ such as a screen reader or voice
     recognition software</a>. This means they interact with the website in a different way, so correctly 
     labelling items in your code such as having ‘alt’ tags for any images means that a screen reader 
     would be able to describe the image for someone with visual impairments. Further to this, there 
     should be a logical structure to pages, with headings and segments correctly labelled in the code, 
     this helps users who need to ‘tab’ through a webpage instead of clicking with a mouse.
    
</p>
    <p>Building on this, adding subtitles to any video content would allow deaf users to get the same
         information from the video as any other person. Another thing to factor in is that colours 
         shouldn’t be the only way users navigate around a website as this would be impossible for a 
         user who was colourblind, colours should be used alongside text to describe actions that need 
         to be taken. 
    </p>
    
        <p>There are many guides online about designing with access needs in mind, but the 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank">W3 reference website</a> 
            provides a fully comprehensive ticklist to ensure your site is catering to all users.

    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
<p>Every single web page is a ‘HTML’ file, this is the language of the web. Hyper Text Markup Language is a 
    ‘text-based’ file which simply means if you viewed these files in a text editor, you’d see the text 
    plus some markup information, which directs how to format the text.</p>
    <p> When adding any images, videos or audio files to a website, there is a balance to be found between the file size, 
        (and how quickly a page would load), with the quality of the file being uploaded, 
        it would be poor UX to upload a very blurry picture for example. 
        The following file types explore the balancing acts used when adding extra content to websites. </p>

   <p> Images, icons and graphics on websites are usually one of these file types: JPEG, GIF or PNG:</p>
    <ul>
   <li>Images are commonly saved as a JPEG file, this is the best option for reducing the file size without
        losing too much quality of the image. You have some flexibility with making files smaller, meaning
         a web page will load quicker.</li>
     
    <li>GIF’s are small image files that work best on non-photographic images, they are commonly used to 
        loop images into a short video.</li>
    
   <li>PNG files are lower quality than JPEG’s but higher quality than GIF’s, so are commonly used for graphics and
        logos as they can also use transparent backgrounds.</li> 
</ul>
   <p>Audio files used on websites can either be a WAV4 file, an MP3 or an AAC file:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>WAV files are an uncompressed audio format, meaning that it is a large file size of very high quality.</li>
    <li>MP3 files are the most common audio files used digitally, these are a lower file size but therefore produce 
    a lower quality audio file.</li>
    <li>AAC files are the same file size as MP3 but give a higher quality sound, they are used by iTunes.</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>Video file types are ever changing and are regularly being replaced, the most common file types are 
        MPEG, FLV and WEBM:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>MPEG is the most commonly used video format on the web. It was designed to combine VHS 
        quality video with CD audio, and gives relatively good video/audio quality at a reasonable file 
        size. (MP3 files are the audio portion of an MPEG file).</li>
    
    <li>FLV files were used to stream videos online using a Flash Player. This was, until recently, the standard file type used on YouTube.
    </li> 
    
    <li>WEBM files are a relatively new video format, conceived to embed short videos on websites in HTML5. 
        As this format is supported by Google, all YouTube videos are now shown in WEBM.</li>
</ul>
